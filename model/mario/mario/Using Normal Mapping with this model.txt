1) Note that I assume you already know how to apply effects to a model.
2) In the MMEffects tab within MikuMikuDance, open the Map Effect File
window and find the "mario.pmx" object. NOTE: Works for Fire, Ice, Flying,
 and Cap models, too.
3) Right-click on it and select "Subset-Extract"
4)You will see a list of materials appear under the object. Apply the
following effects to each material (the normal-mapping effects are found 
in the same folder containing the model's textures):

For MARIO:

Body/Cap -> Mario_all.fx
All other Materials -> mario_eye.fx

For SHADOW MARIO:

Body/Cap -> Mario_all.fx
Eyes -> mario_eye.fx
Eye Glow -> N/A
All Brush-related materials -> default.fx
